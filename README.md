## ergAnalyzer
Project to read and analyze data from electroretinograms.

## About This Project
ergAnalyzer is a project for reading data from a electroretinogram and providing simple results that can be understood by scientists involved in vision research.

## Notes
Data is recorded using the [OcuScience HMsERG LAB System](https://ocuscience.us/pages/hmserg-lab-system). Signal filters within the program adhere to the [International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISEVC) standards](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10633-022-09872-0). Ex vivo sample data of different flash intensities from C57BL/6 mice have been included. Built on Jupyter Notebook on Spyder 5.3.3.
